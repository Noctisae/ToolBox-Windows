# ToolBox-Windows

## What is it ?

A simple repository with a few Powershell scripts I write when I encounter problems with solutions that could be automated on Windows. Nothing huge or ultra-supra-duper-secret state-of-the-art scripts, just things that I've found interesting through the years.

And... I guess that's all.
